# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to see how different Kickstarter campaigns in the Theater category fared based on their launch dates and how the subcategory of plays fared based on their funding goals.

## Results

The balanced accuracy scores and classification reports of all six machine learning models are as follows:

- ### Naive Random Oversampling
